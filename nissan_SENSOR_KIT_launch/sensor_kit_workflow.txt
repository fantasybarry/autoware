### Autoware Sensor Kit Integration Workflow

#### 1. Driver Setup (The "Brain")
Goal: Ensure the software driver for your hardware is running and publishing data.
- Locate the specific launch file:
    * IMU: imu_sensor_kit_launch/launch/imu.launch.xml
    * GPS: gps_sensor_kit_launch/launch/gnss.launch.xml
- Action: Edit these files to <include> the driver provided by your hardware vendor (e.g., xsens, ublox, novatel).
- Verify: Ensure topics are remapped to standard Autoware names (e.g., /sensing/imu/imu_data, /sensing/gnss/pose).

#### 2. Description Setup (The "Body")
Goal: Define the visual link structure so ROS knows the sensor exists.
- Locate: ..._description/urdf/sensors.xacro
- Action: Define the joint and link for your sensor.
- Reference: Use the calibration property to read values from your YAML file automatically.

#### 3. Calibration (The "Position")
Goal: Tell the system exactly where the sensor is mounted relative to the kit base.
- Locate: ..._description/config/sensor_kit_calibration.yaml
- Action: Update x, y, z (meters) and roll, pitch, yaw (radians).
- Tip: These values define the transform from sensor_kit_base_link -> your_sensor_link.

#### 4. Build the Packages
Goal: Compile the new packages so ROS 2 can find them.
- Go to your workspace root (e.g., /home/barry/autoware).
- Action: Run the build command:
    colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select imu_sensor_kit_launch imu_sensor_kit_description gps_sensor_kit_launch gps_sensor_kit_description
- Source the setup: source install/setup.bash

#### 5. Integration & Launch
Goal: Run the sensor kit and verify data.
- Launch:
    ros2 launch imu_sensor_kit_launch sensing.launch.xml
    # OR
    ros2 launch gps_sensor_kit_launch sensing.launch.xml
- Verify Topics:
    ros2 topic list
    ros2 topic echo /sensing/imu/imu_data
- Verify TF (Transforms):
    ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames.py
